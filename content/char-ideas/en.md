# Character Ideas

Strap on your six-guns and saddle up, amigo. It’s time to make your salty gunslinger, mysterious huckster, or savage brave.

Fortunately, making characters for "Deadlands: The Weird West" is as easy as creating characters for any SAVAGE WORLDS game. The hardest part is choosing what kind of hombre you want to play, because the Wild West is chock-full of strange and interesting types.

People from all walks of life find their way to the Weird West, from across the globe in search of fame or fortune. **Your hero can be any kind of person you can imagine. Here are some common character types found in the Weird West, just to get you thinking.**

## Blessed
Whether a nun, rabbi, or chosen slayer, you are one of humanity’s most powerful weapons against the forces of darkness.

## Bounty Hunter
This gun’s for hire. Some folks can evade justice for an awful long time in the lawless frontier towns of the West. Fortunately, you make your grubstake by hunting these varmints down and bringing ‘em in…dead or alive.

## Common Folk
Not everyone is a hard-bitten gunslinger, war-weary soldier, or mysterious huckster. You are an ordinary man or woman—perhaps a craftsman, farmer, or trader—who traveled west seeking a new life and a fresh start. Unfortunately, folks like you are often preyed upon by the horrors and outlaws of the Weird West, so you’re sometimes forced to pick up a gun to survive.

## Deserter
You’ve seen your fair share of death and misery, and won’t be a party to it anymore. Or maybe you’d rather just shoot the bad folks, rather than the ones who wear a particular uniform. Regardless, you were branded a coward and traitor by the military you left behind, and are likely to be executed if ever captured by your former service.

## Drifter
You make a living on odd jobs; more often than not, these odd jobs involve a smoking gun. Good thing you know how to handle one. In any case, you’ve never put down roots in the West, but there isn’t much for you Back East.

## Escort
Most often of the feminine persuasion, these “soiled doves” sometimes work a single saloon, and sometimes travel from town to town plying their trade. Though you seem innocent enough, you can hold your own in the roughest boomtowns in the West. With the upswing in independent, prosperous women over the last decade, male escorts have begun to pop up in bigger cities.

## Explorer
You’re always looking over the next horizon in search of something new. Though you realize the vast virgin territories of yesteryear are gone forever, you also know that many wonders—and horrors—of the West have yet to be uncovered.

## Grifter
You ply your dishonest trade to make a quick buck on the frontier. You’re a snakeoil salesman, a con man who sells worthless elixirs of flavored water and extracts from dubious roots and herbs. Perhaps you search for real “miracle cures,” and finance your quest with ill-gotten gains.

## Hucksters
You plumb Hoyle’s Book of Games for the arcane secrets encoded therein. Some say that within this cryptic text are hidden messages detailing ancient incantations and rituals of the black arts. Others believe hucksters are fakes and frauds. Most have never even heard of these secretive sorcerers. Your spiritual brethren, hexslingers, ply their mystical trade with a double-action pistol rather than a deck of cards.

## Immigrant
Chinese or Mexican, European or African, you are a stranger in a weird land. You bring new and unusual customs to this land of opportunity, which sometimes leads to your persecution.

## Indian Brave
The long Civil War means that neither the USA nor CSA has the will or manpower to subjugate the Sioux Nations or the Coyote Confederation. You are fiercely loyal to your tribe, and once spent your time hunting or patrolling tribal borders. Some braves learn the ways of the white man, while others take up the Old Ways vow.

## Indian Shaman
Shamans have many roles in Indian culture, whether serving the spiritual needs of your people, healing and guarding against sickness, or leading in war. It is rare that one shaman fills all these roles for a single tribe, as the duties are usually divided among shamans with specific expertise. Regardless, all understand the importance of fighting the manitous.

## Law Dog
The West is a wild frontier, with wilder outlaws. It’s up to you—whether you’re a town marshal, county sheriff, or even federal marshal or Texas Ranger—to keep a lid on the worst of them.

## Mad Scientist
You use ghost rock to create infernal devices of steam and steel. Some believe in your genius, others think you mad. Alchemists are mad scientists’ chemical cousins, investing their effort in potions bestowing seemingly magical benefits.

## Muckraker
You believe in reporting the truth above all else, no matter who it offends. Yellow journalism is your stock in trade, and you hope to do a little good by lifting the scales from America’s eyes. Unfortunately, the only organization willing to publish your sometimes wild stories is the Tombstone Epitaph, a notoriously sensational newspaper. The “truth” sometimes requires embellishment to appeal to the skeptical masses. The Epitaph also publishes photographs shot with the incredible Epitaph camera. This camera enables photographers to record images of objects in motion, a feat impossible with mundane cameras. This very success leads many to doubt the authenticity of such photographs, claiming them to be impossible fakes.

## Outlaw
Whether a ruthless bank robber, cold-blooded killer, or innocent fugitive on the run, you have a price on your head and the law on your tail. Some outlaws evade pursuit and build new lives, but some crimes are so heinous that the Union, Confederacy, and everyone in between wants to see the outlaw hanged.

## Prospector
You know there’s gold in them thar hills—not to mention coal, silver, ghost rock, and a host of other valuable fundaments. You’ve spent your life digging for it, and you spend what little you find on wine, women, and song. Only occasionally do prospectors actually strike it rich. A few hunt even more fantastic treasures, though they are often dismissed as dreamers at best, insane at worst.

## Soldier
You bravely serve either the United States or Confederate Army. Whether you fight to preserve the Union or the Confederate States’ right of selfdetermination, you lay your life on the line for a cause more important than yourself. Those who excel climb the ranks to command other soldiers.
